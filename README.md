**Summary**: This course surveys the leading computational frameworks for understanding human intelligence and cognition. Both psychologists and data scientists are working with increasingly large quantities of human behavioral data. Computational cognitive modeling aims to understand behavioral data and the mind and brain, more generally, by building computational models of the cognitive processes that produce the data. This course introduces the goals, philosophy, and technical concepts behind computational cognitive modeling.

The lectures cover artificial neural networks (deep learning), reinforcement learning, Bayesian modeling, model comparison and fitting, classification, probabilistic graphical models, and program induction. Modeling examples span a broad set of psychological abilities including learning, categorization, language, memory, decision making, and reasoning. The homework assignments include examining and implementing the models surveyed in class. Students will leave the course with a richer understanding of how computational modeling advances cognitive science, how cognitive science can inform research in machine learning and AI, and how to fit and evaluate cognitive models to understand behavioral data.

Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

## Pre-requisites
- Math: If you had linear algebra and calculus as an undergrad, or if you have taken Math Tools in the psychology department, you will be in a good position for approaching the material. We will, when needed, review some of the basic technical concepts in lab.
- Programming: For the homework/assignments, we will assume basic familiarity with programming in Python using the Jupyter Notebook system (http://jupyter.org). We will review some of the programming basics in lab. This is a link to helpful tutorial for learning the basics of Python (http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/). We recommend Python 3 for use in this course.

## Grading
The final grade is based on homeworks (50%), final project (35%), and attendance/participation (15%).

## Final Project
The final project proposal is due on Monday, April 1 (one half page written). Please submit via email to instructors-ccm-spring2019@nyuccl.org with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-ccm-proposal.pdf.

The final project is due on Tuesday, May 14. Please submit via email to instructors-ccm-spring2019@nyuccl.org with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-ccm-final.pdf.

The final project will be done in groups of 1-4 students.  A short paper will be turned in describing the project (approximately 6 pages).  The project will represent either an substantial extension of one of the homeworks (e.g., exploring some new aspect of one of the assignments), implementing and extending an existing cognitive modeling paper, or a written paper discussing one of the core modeling topics.

Write-ups should be organized and written as a scientific paper. It must include the following sections: Introduction (with review of related work), Methods/Models, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion. A good example would be to follow the structure of this paper from the class readings:

## Course policies

**Auditing**:  
Please email instructor to see if there are available seats. Priority goes to registered students and then by date of audit request.

**Collaboration and honor code**:  
We encourage you to discuss the homework assignments with your classmates. **You must run the simulations and complete the write-ups for the homeworks on your own.** Under no circumstance should students look at each other's write ups or code, or write-ups or code from previous years.

**Late work**:  
We will take off 10% for each day a homework or final project is late.

**Extra credit**:  
No extra credit will be given, out of interest of fairness.

## Preconfigured cloud environment
Details coming soon.
<!-- Students registered for the course have the option of completing homework assignments on their personal computers, or in a cloud Jupyter environment with all required packages pre-installed. Students can log onto the environment using their github login information [here](http://130.211.189.118/). -->
