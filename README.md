**Key questions**:
- For cognitive scientists: Can we better understand human learning and thought by developing computational cognitive models?
- For data scientists: Can we better understand behavioral data by developing computational cognitive models?

**Summary**: This course provides a survey of computational approaches to understanding human intelligence and cognition. Both psychologists and data scientists are working with increasingly large quantities of human behavioral data. Computational cognitive modeling is the project of understanding behavioral data (and the mind and brain, more generally) by building computational models of the cognitive processes that produce the data. We will cover the goals, philosophy, and technical concepts behind computational cognitive modeling, including model fitting and evaluation. Readings and lectures will survey various computational approaches, including artificial neural networks / deep learning, Bayesian / structured probabilistic models, symbolic and logical systems, and reinforcement learning. We will cover a broad set of psychological applications of these modeling approaches, including learning, memory, decision making, language, categorization, reasoning, and problem solving. Homework assignments will include implementing some of the modeling ideas surveyed in class. Ideally, students will leave the course with a richer understanding of how computational modeling advances cognitive science, how cognitive science can inform research in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and how to fit and evaluate cognitive models for understanding behavioral data.

Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

## Pre-requisites
- Math: If you had linear algebra and calculus as an undergrad, or if you have taken Math Tools in the psychology department, you will be in the best position for approach the material. We will, when needed, review some of the basic technical concepts in lab.
- Programming: For the homework/assignments, we will assume some basic familiarity with programming in Python or Matlab. If you are interested in the above topics and the programming is the main hang up, please consider enrolling. Again, we will review some of the programming basics in lab. An effort will be made to adjust the assignments to people's individual (and hopefully diverse) backgrounds as much as possible.

## Grading
The final grade is based on homeworks (50%), final project (35%), and attendance/participation (15%).

## Course policies

**Auditing**:  
Unfortunately we have no additional spots for auditors due to the large number of previous requests. If we have replied to your request, you may audit pending available seats. Priority goes to registered students and then by date of audit request.

**Collaboration**:  
We encourage you to discuss the homework assignments with your classmates. We expect you to run the simulations and complete the write-ups for the homeworks on your own. Under no circumstance should students look at eachother's write ups. 

**Late work**:  
We will take off 10% for each day a homework or final project is late.

**Extra credit**:  
In the interest of fairness no extra credit will be given.
